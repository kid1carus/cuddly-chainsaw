# DewDrop

## v0.0.7
Adds a new colour detection method which works with transparent icons (ie; Folds) and adds basic support for lock screen notification banners.

## v0.0.6
Changed the banner detection code, hopefully fixing NC/LS banners being changed.

## v0.0.5
Added options which allow the user to enable and disable the tweak (no respring required) and make the banners colour lighter or darker.

> Upcoming: New code to detect if the banner is an actual banner or in the NC/LS. Finally found a new way (suck it Apple) :)

## v0.0.4
Cleaned up the codebase and stopped the colour being added more than once, improving performance.

## v0.0.3
Rewrote a removed iOS 10 method which determined if the banner was banner or in the Notification Center. Currently in testing.

## v0.0.2
Fixed the previous issue slightly by changing what view was affected by the colour change.

## v0.0.1
Initial release, has some bugs where banners might be darker when using themes that have transparency.
